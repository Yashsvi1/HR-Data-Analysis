# Attrition Analyzer

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to analyze HR data to identify relevant trends and provide insights for informed decision-making. By examining various aspects of HR data, the project aims to support effective workforce management and retention strategies.

## Description

In the "Attrition Analyzer" project, I created five comprehensive dashboards to explore different facets of HR data. The project is structured as follows:

1. **Overview Dashboard**: Provides a summary of all four subsequent dashboards, offering a high-level view of the insights gathered.
2. **Demographic Insights Dashboard**: Summarizes employee statistics, including age groups, gender, distance from home, and marital status. This dashboard helps understand workforce diversity and commuting patterns.
3. **Turnover Analysis Dashboard I**: Focuses on employee attrition by department, job roles, business travel impact, and total years in the current role. This analysis aids in workforce management and retention strategies.
4. **Turnover Analysis Dashboard II**: Examines attrition by job level, overtime performance ratings, monthly income, and attrition increase levels, providing critical insights for effective HR strategies and decision-making.
5. **Employee Wellness Dashboard**: Analyzes relationship satisfaction, environment satisfaction, job satisfaction, job involvement, and work-life balance. These metrics help organizations enhance engagement, boost morale, and improve productivity.

### Data Cleaning Tasks

To ensure the data was accurate and ready for analysis, the following data cleaning tasks were performed:

- Deleting redundant columns.
- Renaming columns for clarity.
- Dropping duplicate entries.
- Cleaning individual columns.
- Removing NaN values from the dataset.
- Performing additional data transformations as needed.

### Data Visualization

Key visualizations included:

- Correlation map for all numeric variables.
- Analysis of Overtime, Marital Status, Job Role, Gender, Education Field, Department, Business Travel.
- Relationships between Overtime and Age, Total Working Years, Education Level, Number of Companies Worked, Distance from Home.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Microsoft Power BI**: This project was implemented using Microsoft Power BI, a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool that enables interactive data analysis and visual storytelling.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **/data**: Contains the HR dataset used for analysis.
- **/reports**: Includes the final Power BI report files (.pbix) showcasing the analysis and visualizations.
- **README.md**: This readme file, providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

Once the Power BI report is open, you can interact with various dashboards to explore the HR data. Use filters and slicers to drill down into specific demographics, job roles, satisfaction metrics, or other dimensions to gain deeper insights.
